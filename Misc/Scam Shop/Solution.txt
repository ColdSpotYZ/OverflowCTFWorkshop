In this challenge, user are given 4 options which are:
  [0]Exit
  [1]Check Your Money/Balance
  [2]Buy Fake Flag
  [3]Buy Authentic Flag
From this options there are 2 flags, one is fake and one is real.

When Option [1] is chosen:
  You chose option [1]
  You have $100

When Option [3] is chosen:
  You chose option [3]
  1 Authentic Flag = $100,000
  You do not have enough money
  
When Option [2] is chosen:
1 Fake Flag = $20
How many Fake Flag do you want to buy? 
Currently, the user is only able to buy the fake flag with their $100 balance.

From this, we can deduced that we need to do something to option [2] to obtain a higher balance for option [3]

Looking at the source code given:
  int cost;
  cost = amountFakeFlag * 20;
  Balance = Balance - cost;
these 3 lines looks suspicious..
